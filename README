libcurl.NET 1.3 (c) 2004, 2005 Jeff Phillips jeff@jeffp.net

This is the initial public source code release of this product
on sourceforge.net.

This release contains all of the binaries necessary to run the
sample applications in the samples subdirectory, but ensure that
you read the file ReadMe.samples in that directory for more
information on building and running the samples. You should be
able to build the samples with only the csc or vbc command-line
compilers.

If you want to rebuild LibCurlNet.dll and LibCurlShim.dll in the
bin subdirectory, you can do so by opening up the LibCurlNet.sln
file in this directory with Microsoft Visual Studio 7.1 or higher.
These files will be rebuilt in the bin subdirectory.

The libcurl.dll file in the bin subdirectory was built with SSL,
c-ares (asynchronous DNS) and zlib (for compression) linked in. I
will try to update this file as libcurl evolves.

API documentation is provided in the file LibCurlNet.chm in the
doc subdirectory. You should be able to view it in Microsoft's
HTML Help viewer (hh.exe). If you change the API and wish to
rebuild the documentation, you'll need to use the NDOC tool
(minimum version 1.3) available at ndoc.sourceforge.net.

The CURLOPT_SSL_CTX_FUNCTION issue remains: The Easy class has a delegate
for this function. But the delegate is called with a reference to an 
SSLContext object which is just a thin wrapper of a native OpenSSL SSL_CTX
pointer. I didn't provide a managed wrapper for an SSL_CTX pointer and
don't expect to do so in the future. So if you want to work with the
SSL_CTX pointer (SSLContext.Context), you'll have to do so using your own
native methods.
